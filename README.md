# Heart-Disease Prediction


BUISENESS CASE :
BASE ON GIVEN FEATURE AND MESUREMENT PREDICT WHETHER PATIENT WILL HAVE HEART DISEASE OR NOT.

Task:
BINARY CLASSIFICATION TASK


INTRODUCTION OF PROJECT:
Cardiovascular disease or heart disease is the leading cause of death amongst women and men and amongst most racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease. From the CDC, roughly every 1 in 4 deaths each year are due to heart disease. The WHO states that human life style is the main reason behind this heart problem. Apart from this there are many key factors which warns that the person may/may not getting chance of heart disease.

The term heart disease is often used interchangeably with the term cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke.

DOMAIN ANALYSIS
TARGET COLUMN == HEART DISEASE PRESENT
In this project we are going to analyze that how other feature of dataset affecting heart disease

1.PATIENT ID: 
Id of particular patient, Id is used to identify a patient, this is a unique column so that its not affect to heart disease

2.SLOPE OF PEAK EXERCISE ST SEGMENT: 
While a high ST depression is considered normal & healthy. The “ slope ” hue, refers to the peak exercise ST segment, with values: 1: upsloping, 2: flat, 3: down-sloping). Both positive & negative heart disease patients exhibit equal distributions of the 3 slope categories.

3.THAL:
A blood disorder called thalassemia,[normal, reversible defect, fixed defect]

4.RESTING BLOOD PRESSURE: 
blood pressure tells a lot about your general health. High blood pressure or hypertension can lead to several heart related issues and other medical conditions. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to stroke.

5.CHEST PAIN TYPE:
Most of the chest pain causes are not dangerous to health, but some are serious, while the least cases are life-threatening.[TA: typical angina(1), ATA: Atypical angina(2), NAP: non-anginal pain(3), ASY: asymptomatic (4) ]

6.NUM OF MAJOR VESSELS: 
Major Blood Vessels of the Heart: Blood exits the right ventricle through the pulmonary trunk artery. Approximately two inches superior to the base of the heart, this vessel branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries, which transport blood into the lungs.[number of major vessels: 0 to 3]

7.FASTING BLOOD SUGAR: 
Your Fasting blood sugar level of 120 is a High Fasting blood sugar level. If your Fasting blood sugar is in between 74 mg/dL and 99 mg/dL, then you need not worry as 74-99 mg/dL is the normal range for Fasting blood sugar. But if your Fasting blood sugar is lesser or greater than the above values, then there may be some problem in your body.
(fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

8.RESTING EKG/ECG RESULT: 
The electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a test that measures the heart’s electrical activity, and a resting ECG is administered when the patient is at rest. It involves noninvasive recording with adhesive skin electrodes placed on specially prepared spots on the skin, and it plots out the heart's activity on a graph. It is used to determine the health of the heart and circulatory system and to help diagnose issues with associated body systems.[0: normal, 1:having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), 2:showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria]

9.SERUM CHOLESTEROL:  
A person’s serum cholesterol level represents the amount of total cholesterol in their blood. A person’s serum cholesterol level comprises the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides in the blood. Triglycerides are a type of fat bundled with cholesterol.

10. oldpeak_eq_st_depression: 
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, a measure of abnormality in electrocardiograms

11.SEX:
sex (1 = male; 0 = female)

12.AGE: 
age in years




13.MAX HEART RATE: 
It has been shown that an increase in heart rate by 10 beats per minute was associated with an increase in the risk of cardiac death by at least 20%, and this increase in the risk is similar to the one observed with an increase in systolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg.[Average heart rate: 60 to 100 bpm]

14.EXERCISE INDUCED ANGINA:
Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.[0: no, 1: yes]

15.HEART DISEASE PRESENT:
[0: no heart disease present, 1: heart disease present]
